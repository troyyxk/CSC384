1. The two anytime search are really similiar to each other. The only difference is the different cost bounds to use for each iterations.

2. One of the most important issues regarding the Sokoban are the deadlocks in the map. Keep in mind that deadlocks also exists in places other than the corners.

3. To make the heur_alternative run faster, not only do you need to consider the distance of the boxs to storages to put into, but also the distance between the robots and the boxes.

4. Remember that heuristic is an estimate, not the actual cost to the storage. Actually implement the cost actually cost as the hueristic will cost an extremely long time.

5. It would greatly increase the speed for the search if you could design an algorithm that match each box to a specific storage.
